# messaging-app

### A project in my Fall 2021 Software Design class at Central College

A messaging program that allows users to communicate with others and attain followers on the same network. This app is incorporated with Java and HTML to complete the graphical user interface frontend and backend.

Both the design diagrams and code are included in the `main` branch of this repository. The backend code is in the `/MessageDriver` directory, and the frontend code is in the `/MessagingGUI` directory.
